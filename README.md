# Holidays around the world

This app allows a user to click on a country flag which when clicked, 
opens a modal window that contains the country name, capital, and flag. 
Then below the country info it displays a list of holidays celebrated 
in that country. This site is also primarily an example of using data 
from two apis in a single webpage.

### Testing 

This website was made for testing and educational purposes only. 


#### Further experimentation

Might include combining this data into a more fully functional 
calendar app with a custom ui and an event planner.
